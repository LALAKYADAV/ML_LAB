# Hard Margin SVM using CVXOPT

This repository contains Python code for implementing a hard margin Support Vector Machine (SVM)( specially dual form ) using the CVXOPT library.

## Overview

Support Vector Machines are powerful supervised learning models used for classification and regression tasks. In this implementation, we focus on the hard margin SVM, which aims to find the maximum margin hyperplane that separates two classes in the feature space.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- CVXOPT

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy cvxopt
```

## Files
- `svm_hard_margin.ipynb`: Main script for training the hard margin SVM.

## Dataset
Dataset is created in .ipynb file.

## Theoritcal Approach

- The hard margin SVM optimization problem is formulated as a quadratic programming (QP) problem and solved using the CVXOPT library.
- Decision boundary and support vectors are visualized using Matplotlib.
